FIRST RUN THE OpenThisFirst.py FILE TO SET UP YOUR CONFIGURATION SO YOUR BOT WORKS (or just edit the Settings.ini file manually)
Also fill up Conmmands.py with commands or your bot won't be doing anything substantial
Finally, run the Run.py file to start up your bot. You can turn off the bot by typing !quit into your twitch chat.
